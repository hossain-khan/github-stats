This serves as a foundation for additional authentication and authorization systems that are in flight.  For more context on a larger design consult the [draft pull request](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/4247) that uses an open source 3rd party authentication and authorization system.\r\n\r\nAlso see\r\n- https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4514\r\n- https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/3846\r\n- https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/4247\r\n- https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-sdk-java/blob/main/SECURITY.md\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved\r\n- Related https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4514\r\n\r\n### Check List\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n  - [X] All tests pass\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented.\r\n  - [X] New functionality has javadoc added\r\n- [X] Commits are signed per the DCO using --signoff\r\n- [x] Commit changes are listed out in CHANGELOG.md file (See: [Changelog](../blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog))\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\nFor more information on following Developer Certificate of Origin and signing off your commits, please check [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin).\r\n",
