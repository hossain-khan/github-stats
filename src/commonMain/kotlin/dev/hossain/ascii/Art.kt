     * - PR reviewer's time zone is not known (though it can be configured in [UserTimeZone]).
     * - Weekends may not be same in all countries
     * - Holidays or days off by PR reviewer are not considered
     * - Similar to holidays there is no way to input unexpected absence.
     * - The tool defined here to diff time likely has bugs/flaws.
