This means shifting the network latency problem to a time synchronization one.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the client's time should be correct but, in the event this isn't true, a server time estimation is made by the client (clients always use this at the moment).\r\n\r\nA major problem faced was the delay caused by issuing a play command on the web-player and it actually starting the playback. This issue has been solved by speeding up the playback to catch up.\r\nIn other words, to implement this feature on other players, the \"playback rate\" (or speed) should be supported by the player to achieve optimal results.\r\n\r\nFeedback and change proposals are welcome.\r\nI'm curious to see whether the current UX is ideal or if some things should be revised.\r\n\r\n**Planned features for this PR**\r\n- [x] Option to toggle feature for specific user [User edit > Media Playback > Syncplay access]\r\n- [x] Filter groups by library access and parental rating (needs review)\r\n\r\n**Proposed features for future PRs**\r\n- Share the transcoding process with the members of the group\r\n- Manually adjust delay\r\n- Time sync between devices in the same network\r\n- Group types (public, private, personal)\r\n- Group join by PIN\r\n\r\n**Features being tackled in next PR**\r\n- Sync playlist as well (more discussion needed)\r\n- Group wait when one or more members of a group are buffering\r\n\r\n**Issues**\r\nAddresses some requested features of https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/227.",

I'm not familiar with the code base so I thought I'd throw the question out to those that are.\r\n\r\n[SyncLounge](http://synclounge.tv/) seems to be a third party option someone wrote for Plex. I think that if it's not difficult to implement natively, people could consider this feature a huge plus for Jellyfin as well as a possible way to distinguish itself from the commercial options.",

I need to remind that it's not only a burden on you to implement stuff but also a burden on us to review it, so it's waaaaaaaaaaay better to have a thing come in several atomic PRs (each of them should ideally leave the product functional, even if not at the completely desired state) than in one giant PR that would be reviewed for weeks.\r\n\r\nI must ask again, what is left on the server part to mark it as a first usable stage? IMHO the first usable stage is when syncplay is possible to be turned on/off globally by server admin and is joinable by anyone on the server. No groups types, no group pins, not even waiting is exactly needed. People can circumvent waiting by pausing manually (they're likely to be over some other communication channel to be able to ask to pause or pause themselves if it buffers).\r\n\r\nSo we can get this PR in, and _then_ build PRs that improve and polish the feature.",

This feature was originally not working (GET `/socket` requests would 404) until I modified my reverse proxy settings. According to [this blog which helped me get it working](https://medium.com/@ibraheemabukaff/how-to-proxy-websockets-with-nginx-e333a5f0c0bb), websockets rely on some HTTP headers that are not forwarded through proxies by default.\r\n\r\nPerhaps [the reverse proxy instructions](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/index.html) should be revised. The release notes should mention that websockets (which this relies on) may not work out of the box with an already working reverse proxy. \r\n\r\nI added the new `location /socket` part to my nginx config and now it works fine.\r\n```\r\nserver {\r\n  server_name MyServer.com;\r\n  location /socket {\r\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n    proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\r\n    proxy_pass \"http://localhost:8096/socket\";\r\n  }\r\n  location / {\r\n    proxy_pass http://localhost:8096/;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "> I run jellyfin on port 8096 and use a reverse proxy to access it from port 80/443. This feature was originally not working (GET `/socket` requests would 404) until I modified my reverse proxy settings. According to [this blog which helped me get it working](https://medium.com/@ibraheemabukaff/how-to-proxy-websockets-with-nginx-e333a5f0c0bb), websockets rely on some HTTP headers that are not forwarded through proxies by default.\r\n> \r\n> Perhaps [the reverse proxy instructions](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/index.html) should be revised. The release notes should mention that websockets (which this relies on) may not work out of the box with an already working reverse proxy.\r\n> \r\n> I added the new `location /socket` part to my nginx config and now it works fine.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> server {\r\n>   server_name MyServer.com;\r\n>   location /socket {\r\n>     proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n>     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n>     proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\r\n>     proxy_pass \"http://localhost:8096/socket\";\r\n>   }\r\n>   location / {\r\n>     proxy_pass http://localhost:8096/;\r\n>   }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI can confirm, my setup looks similar :smile:. I got the configuration directly from the Jellyfin [docs](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/nginx.html) though (using Nginx).",
